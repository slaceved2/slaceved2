I have spent most of my career providing software solutions making the companies I worked for more efficient and agile. I love puzzles, encryption, and finding the right solution for a given opportunity. Software engineering allows me to add new tools to my toolbox while learning new ways to apply tried-and-true tools. You can’t beat that “look, see what I can do” feeling when you have perfected a new algorithm.
